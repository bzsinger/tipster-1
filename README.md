## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
* Added switch to turn animations on/off (default: on)

## Notes

Swift is an exciting language and I am thoroughly enjoying learning it.  The biggest challenge is how fast the language is changing, and therefore the number of guides available online using deprecated syntax.
